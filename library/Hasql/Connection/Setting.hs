-- | Whether prepared statements are allowed.
--
-- When 'False', even the statements marked as preparable will be executed without preparation.
--
-- This is useful when dealing with proxying applications like @pgbouncer@, which may be incompatible with prepared statements.
-- Consult their docs or just set it to 'False' to stay on the safe side.
-- It should be noted that starting from version @1.21.0@ @pgbouncer@ now does provide support for prepared statements.
--
-- 'True' by default.
